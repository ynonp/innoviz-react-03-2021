2. Create a component called "LightBulb" that can be turned "on" or "off". An "on" light bulb has a yellow background, an "off" has transparent background. Each lightbulb has a button to toggle it:

```
<div class="lightbulb">
  <div style="width:100px; height:100px; background:yellow; display: inline-block"></div>
  <button>Toggle</button>
</div>
```
